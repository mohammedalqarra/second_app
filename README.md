# second_app

I developed this app (create a quiz) as a project for an undergraduate class using flutter ( The app will use SQLite to store user data, including quiz questions and answers ) package to manage data so teacher can store some questions and student can do quizzes and I used Flutter Screenutil Package to make the app flexible for many screens . I also used the provider package as state management.

- Home Page Screen
- Create Quiz Screen
- Add New Question Screen
- Start Quiz Screen
- Result screen => Score is >= 75% • Score >= 50% • Otherwise
- SQLite Integration
- validation
